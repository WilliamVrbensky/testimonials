Thank you for downloading our plugin.

Upon installation and activation of the plugin, you will notice a new page on your WordPress dashboard titled "Testimonials" on the left hand side of your WordPress dashboard.

Once you click on "Testimonials" it will direct you to a page where you will be able to access all of your testimonial posts. Once you click on "Add New Testimonials," type in reviews from your clients and style it how you want it to appear on your website.

In order for your testimonials to show up on your website, copy and paste the shortcode below onto the page you wish to show it:
[testimonial posts_per_page="5" orderby="rand"]

This will activate the testimonias that you added into the "Testimonials" tab on the WordPress dashboard.

If you select Widgets under Appearances on the left hand side of your WordPress dashboard, you will see our widget called "Testimonials" under available widgets. Drag and drop it over to your desired widget area. Click on it to add a title of your choice, type in the desired amount of testimonials you wish to show and select whether you want the widget to order your testimonials by date, by random, or by no order whatsoever. 

Click save and you will see your client testimonials on the widget area you put it under.

Enjoy!
