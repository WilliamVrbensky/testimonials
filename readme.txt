Thank you for downloading our plugin.

Upon installation and activation of the plugin, you will notice a new page on your WordPress dashboard titled "Testimonials" on the left hand side of your WordPress dashboard.

Click on "Testimonials" and it will direct you to a page where you can access all of your testimonial posts. Click on "Add New Testimonial" to type in a review from a client and then style your content the way you want it to look on your website. We recommend that you italicize testimonials and bold the client's name who wrote each testimonial to make it stand out on your website.

In order for your testimonials to show up on your website, copy and paste the shortcode below onto the page you wish to display it on:
[testimonial posts_per_page="5" orderby="rand"]

This will activate the testimonial posts that you made in the "Testimonials" tab on the WordPress dashboard. The shortcode is currently set to 5 testimonials per page and its order is set to random. You can specify how many testimonials you would like to show on the page by changing the number in the "post_per_page" variable. You can also change the specific order of your testimonial posts with the "orderby" variable. If you want to set its order to display the most recent posts at the top, type in "recent". If you want to randomize the order, type in "rand".

We also give you the option to use our plugin as a widget. If you desire to do so, please follow these instructions:

Select Widgets under Appearances on the left hand side of your WordPress dashboard. You will see our widget called "Testimonials" under available widgets. Drag and drop "Testimonials" over to your desired widget area. Now click on "Testimonials" to add a title of your choice, enter the desired amount of testimonials you wish to show off, and select whether you want the widget to order your testimonials by date, by random, or by no specific order whatsoever. 

Click save and you will see your client testimonials on your website's widget area you put it under.

We hope you enjoy our plugin and get more customers by showing off your testimonials.
